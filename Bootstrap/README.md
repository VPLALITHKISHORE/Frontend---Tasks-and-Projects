# Responsive Website Task using Bootstrap

This task demonstrates how Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system and utility classes can save time and simplify responsive design. Instead of writing custom @media queries ðŸ˜…, I leveraged Bootstrap to ensure the layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes â€” from full desktop to mobile.
